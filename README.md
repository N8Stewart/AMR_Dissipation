# AMR_Dissipation
A simplified AMR Dissipation program to demonstrate parallel programming on a SuperComputer

## Project explanation
Using PThreads and OpenMP, the goal is to parallelize the execution of a specific, scientific computation. The details of this computation are provided in the included PDF file. Several checkpoints are included to demonstrate the results of the different implementations.
